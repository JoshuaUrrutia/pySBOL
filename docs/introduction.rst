Introduction
============
**pySBOL** provides Python interfaces and their implementation for `Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) <http://www.sbolstandard.org/>`_. The current version of pySBOL implements `SBOL Core Specification 2.1.0 <http://sbolstandard.org/downloads/specifications/specification-data-model-2-1-0/>`_. The library provides an API to work with SBOL objects, the functionality to read GenBank, FASTA, and SBOL version 1 and 2 documents as XML/RDF files, to write GenBank, FASTA, and SBOL version 1 and 2 documents, and to validate the correctness of SBOL 2 documents. This is a Python binding for C/C++ based `libSBOL <https://github.com/SynBioDex/libSBOL>`_. Currently, pySBOL supports Python version 2.7 and 3.5 only. pySBOL is made freely available under the `Apache 2.0 license <https://www.apache.org/licenses/>`_.

To install, go to `Installation <https://pysbol2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_ Page.

The current snapshot of pySBOL is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/SynBioDex/pysbol2>`_.
Any problems or feature requests for pySBOL should be reported on the `GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/SynBioDex/pysbol2/issues>`_.
An overview of pySBOL can be found `here <http://sbolstandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SBOL-Tutorial.pdf>`_.
For further information about the pySBOL library, its implementation, or its usage, please feel free to `contact the libSBOL team <http://sbolstandard.org/contact/>`_.


pySBOL is brought to you by Bryan Bartley, Kiri Choi, and SBOL Developers.

Current support for the development of pySBOL is generously provided by the NSF through the `Synthetic Biology Open Language Resource <http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1355909>`_ collaborative award.
